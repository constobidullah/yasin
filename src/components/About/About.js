                <p className='text-justify mx-20'>I'm an Upwork freelancer specializing in Graphic Design and photo retouching using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom. <br />
                    I'm ready to use all my knowledge and skills to make your Design on a higher professional level. <br />
                    You will get the highest quality service from me. <br />
                     Always keep deadlines. <br />
                      Always in touch. Always ready to make urgent tasks for my clients. <br /> <br />

                    âœ…My goal is to provide the best results for all of my clients at reasonable prices. <br />

                    Making complex photo manipulations, photo retouching, and editing is my passion for a long time.  <br />
                     Please be as specific as possible. The more you give me, the better I can do my job. <br />

                    I'm proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, and Adobe Illustrator. <br />

                    I am also an expert in Microsoft Office, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. <br /> <br />

                    âœ… I started learning Illustrator at first. <br /> Then I decided to learn Photoshop. <br /> When I started learning Photoshop, I felt that it was entertaining me more than anything. <br /> So I determined that I have to be a Graphic designer. <br /> I learned Lightroom to take my editing to a professional level. <br /> <br />
                    ðŸŽ“Finally I enrolled in a course provided by the Govt of Bangladesh <br /> and got a certificate after completing the course. <br /> <br />
